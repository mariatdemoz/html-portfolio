<h1>My all time favourite movies at the moment</h1>
<h2>Let's be honest I didn't see yet enough movies in my life time to rank them once and for all</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Soul</h3>
<p>Love me some animation, I felt that this one was thought for a more adult audiance and the aspect of dreams and reality clashing and how philosophical it was made and makes it great. I cried a little!</p>
<h3>Death Poets Society </h3>
<p>Very inspirational Robbin Williams has been one of those actors that when I see in a movie I am quite sure I will like, and hey this was outstanding, as well as Good Will Hunting, another gem. </p>
<h3>Hitch</h3>
<p>I love commedies, and I find comfort in romantic commedies so I nthought to bring in one of my faves. I think I love the aspect of the actors interacting with eachother and mostly I love watchinng it with others and comment. Comfort movie it is.</p>
