<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As someone on a contant journey of dicovery and change Finding a way to describe oneself is not easy. 
  I would say firstly that I am someone that can use a little bit of sintesis at times. I like dicovering and challenges,
  take as an example this one, I am not born a tech girl but curiosiy and a set of different achievment led me to try it
  and I am liking it so much even if it's not the most expected from me.
  I just graduated callege, I am attending to access the Masters Degree in Global development and entrepreneurship, 
  specifically the entrepreneurship curriculum.

<p>Right now I am trying to learn Web development to have some knowladge of the programming world, I am really interested
  in data analysis and the ability to back up strategies and decisions through it. 
  And additionally I am studying French too, so that my available comunication skills could be brodened and have the ability 
  to know more people. 
  My hope is to grow the knowladge both horizzontally and vertically, so that when I get in the work field I can be effective 
  and efficient and be an added value to the community I am in.

<p>My other hobies are illustration, and also writing. I have a instagram page that I describe as : 
  "A collection of a life scavenger hunter's illustrated journal pages.
  You're welcome to look, read and enrich this pages."
  Other things I love are photography, music, nature, books, lifestyle videos and design from digital to material, from arquitecture 
  to fashion, but above all I like sharing moments with those I love.
